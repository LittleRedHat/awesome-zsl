# awesome-zsl

A list recent papers, notes, codes, tutorials and other resources  on zero-shot learning [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

**NOTE:** I am so lazy, so i will write notes only for these inspiring papers just on the weekend. Actually, this repo is only a reading sharing of me not a curated list of awesome ZSL resources. The name is just for fun :blush::blush:
